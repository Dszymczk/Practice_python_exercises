# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then
# generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions.
# Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
# (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the
# sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like
# this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
